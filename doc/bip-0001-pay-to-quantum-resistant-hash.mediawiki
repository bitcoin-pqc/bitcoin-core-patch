==Abstract==

This BIP proposes a new opcode `OP_CHECKPQCVERIFY` that enables quantum-resistant signature verification in Bitcoin script, allowing for the creation of quantum-resistant payment addresses.

==Motivation==

The advent of quantum computing poses a potential threat to Bitcoin's current ECDSA signatures. This BIP introduces a mechanism to create quantum-resistant payment addresses, providing a path for users to secure their funds against potential quantum attacks.

==Specification==

===New Opcode===

* OP_CHECKPQCVERIFY (0xb1)
  * Pops the top three items from the stack: public key, signature, and message hash
  * Verifies the quantum-resistant signature against the message hash using the provided public key
  * Fails if verification fails
  * Succeeds if verification passes

===Address Format===

[To be specified: Details about the new address format for quantum-resistant payments]

===Signature Scheme===

[To be specified: Details about the specific quantum-resistant signature scheme to be used]

==Backward Compatibility==

This is a soft fork, as it only adds a new opcode. Old nodes will treat transactions using this opcode as "anyone can spend" transactions, while new nodes will enforce the quantum-resistant signature verification.

==Reference Implementation==

The reference implementation is available in the bitcoin-core-patch repository:
https://github.com/bitcoin-pqc/bitcoin-core-patch

==Rationale==

[To be expanded: Discussion of signature scheme choices, security considerations, and implementation details]
